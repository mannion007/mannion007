## About Me

I am the dad of 2 girls; Erin and Edie. I am engaged to be married to my partner of 10 years in 2023. I am an only child, I have very close relationships with my parents and a circle of lifelong friends. I am a dog person and Simpsons Superfan, I often joke in Simpsons references and memes. My entire family loves computer games. I love retro and obscure tech, I am most proud of my Amiga 1200 which I have modified and upgraded over the years.

I live in Kent (UK). Compared to London, things are quiet and life moves slower at home. I enjoy hiking with the kids and riding my mountain bike through the woods. I love the contrasting energy of London for the work side of my life. I currently work primarily remotely but make the habit of travelling into the city to get a change of scenery, see the team and drink expensive coffee at least once per week.

I did go to university but regrettably, I didn't study Computer Science. My first tech job was in 2005, and several roles many years later I still passionately love working in tech and over the years I have independently studied Computer Science on many levels to backfill my knowledge.

## My Job

I am a Solutions Architect at Lendable. I see my core responsibility to be oil in the machine of the Engineering teams, facilitating and enabling them to make decisions at all levels and keep delivering. I enjoy the variety of work and the opportunity to build relationships with our awesome engineering teams so that I can serve them with empathy and bring actual value. I make a conscious effort to listen, understand and add value to teams by bringing questions and insights from an additional perspective.

A perfect day at work for me is an equal split of:
- whiteboard time, exploring a complex technical problem
- facilitating sessions to learn about problems and model solutions (I am a strong advocate and lifetime student of Domain Driven Design)
- hands-on development - reading and writing plenty of code (I have spent most of my career writing PHP but also several years studying Golang)

## How to engage with me

By any means that you are comfortable with! I love meeting and getting to know my colleagues in any way possible, understanding what challenges they are solving and taking every opportunity to help where I can.

I value honest feedback on my approach and performance in any form. I owe all that I know to the people I have worked with over the years and I never want to stop learning and growing.

## Work values (not an exhaustive list)

### Knowing the value of our work

Seeing the result of our efforts. I believe the stereotype of computer programmers being people who solely care about writing code is antiquated. I believe engineers must engineer - understand problem spaces fully and apply their craft to deliver effective solutions, with the ability to write elegant code is just one feather in their cap. Seeing the real-world change we make through our efforts is vitally important to me.

### Everyone is a mentor - trust and respect underpin everything

It is my strong belief that peer mentorship is one of the most powerful ways to keep engineers engaged and productive. Regardless of title or years of experience, everyone has had a different path into tech, with different areas of interest, experience and expertise - everyone can and should have and take the opportunity to learn from everyone. A healthy team recognises and values the excellence in everyone by encouraging and sponsoring them in further developing and sharing it.

### Getting it right > being right

I believe that building effective software is difficult. A large part of our job is being creative to have lots of ideas for solutions and then being structured in our approach to picking the most effective one.

## Things you may see me struggle with

### Impostor syndrome
I often lack confidence in my abilities and judgment. Historically, this has led to analysis paralysis, but I feel with the help of awesome mentors and colleagues at Lendable I have learned to manage and control this trait.
